ABOUT PROJECT NEER
India is blessed with many unique craftsmen ship. One such profession is of potters. But now this art is limited to some rural regions only. It is hard to find a good pot without a massive overhead price.Project “NEER” mainly focus on uplifting the craftsmen ship of potter community in the city of Prayagraj. Despite many benefits of Pots/Pottery, the common mass prefer plastic. This not only affects the incomes of the potter community but also creates pollution.This art is gradually dyeing due to lack of connectivity to the market and due to use of excessive plastics.Not only will the project help the community to create another source of income, but it will also keep them motivated in what they do.
Prayagraj is situated on the river banks of the Ganges. The ground water needs minimal purification.Potter community in the city is highly skilled. It took us no time in finding a community which could do the job. Also, that there are many poor communities of people who can’t afford RO water purifiers.Most of the commercially available water purifiers are costly and generally made up of plastics. So, to reduce the use of plastic and also encouraging AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyanwe excel towards this project. By this project we are also aiming to give the poor potter community a chance to expand their market other than their normal customers.
PRODUCT PROPOSAL	
•	The design of the water purifier will consist of two mud pots one on top of other with a little variation in the size and shape. The main part of the purifier is a ceramic candle from which impurified water percolates downward to the lower container.
•	Turbidity, suspended materials,bacteria, protozoa and cysts are removed(not pathogens)from water through mechanical trapping and adsorption in micro-scale pores of ceramic candles. 
•	This method lowers the TDS(Total dissolved solids) of the water sample and gives you water of certain TDS(but not below that).
•	The effectiveness of the filter also depends on the production quality, the initial water quality, and the handling practices of users. Highly turbid or iron containing water may plug candle pores easily so that container and candle need to be cleaned more frequently. 


PROJECT UPDATE
•	Firstly, we conducted different market surveys so that we could get the idea of the use of the product.
•	Then we approached the potter communities and explained them the design of mud pot filter.
•	Then the samples of mud pot filter were collected and testing of water samples is in the process.

CHALLENGES
•	The maximum possible components should be eco-friendly and at the same time not compromising with the health of customers. 
•	Finding a design which is easy to comprehend and implement by potters.
•	 The design should not require significantly extra time and effort such that eventually leading to rise in indirect cost.
•	Providing variations in the product to trigger maximum possible market base.
•	Establishment of entire supply chain keeping in mind to minimize the overall operational economy as well.
•	Keeping the scope of exploitation of potters due to system at its possible least by maximizing transparency.
