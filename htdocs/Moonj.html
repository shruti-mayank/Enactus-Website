    <h4 class="service-title"><a href="">Project Moonj</a></h4>
    <p class="service-description">
      Our most recent venture in collaboration with the initiative by MHRD and state government of Uttar Pradesh under <a href="http://odopup.in/en/article/district-profile-allahabad">'One District One Product Scheme'.</a> The project aims at empowering the indigenious Moonj based handicraft products which have been facing existential challenge over the years.
      <br>
      <strong><u>Motivation</u></strong> The Naini area of Allahabad has been recognised widely for its <a href="https://medium.com/direct-create/moonj-basketry-form-uttar-pradesh-cfd5aad98dd0">Moonj Craft. </a>But with time iy has been losing its charm and today it is significantly far from the time of its glory. The market offers variety of products made from the moonj like basket(daliya in Hindi), coaster stand, bags, decorative items and more. Eco-friendly moonj products have the potential to do well in the national as well as international markets.
      <br>
      <strong><u>Goal</u></strong> The team aspires to look for taking he plunge into variuos aspects related to supply chain, marketing, promotion and technological R&D assistance to tackle the various challenges which have been holding back this art to achieve the glory it deserves.

 Project Moonj under the 'One district, one product' initiative.
Before diving into the project, we would love to introduce to you what this project is about. What moonj is. And why is Moonj basketry a pride for our Prayagraj. 
Moonj is the outer layer of a type of grass called ‘sarpat.’ This layer is peeled off and knotted as it is easy to store and dry. These knots are locally known as 'balla'. Kaasa grass is dried and wrapped with moonj grass by rolling around kaasa. The motifs of basketry are then formed by dying and stitching with great expertise. The final product baskets, have a touch of our culture. 
Moonj basketry comprises of our Allahabad's oldest heritage and with time it's awareness is decreasing. And to bring back this beautiful craft, we at Enactus decided to dive into this project and give this project the recognition it deserves. 

From first field visit, we had the following insights-
1) They are technologically deficient. Which meant they are not at all prone to e-commerce world. 
2) Kids and men aren't supporting women. The work solely is being done by women. Which leads to dependency on a middle man, who takes away a lot of their profit. And also leads to lack of interest in younger generation which might lead to extinct of a wholesome art. 
3) Cost is too low. The earn a monthly income of 1500 INR which is too low in regards to the time and efforts they put in. 
4) Production rate is low. Since they don't prefer machines and knitting by hand takes a lot of time. 

Looking forward to-
1) The manual process is time consuming. At times, it takes weeks to design a moonj product. We are trying methods, which can be used in needle movement for knotting the spirals so that the products are masterly crafted. To create a space in the market, we need to increase production without affecting employment
2) We will use the cultural heritage of Prayagraj. The Magh Mela and other Fairs, will act as a direct source of sale. 
3) Making them technologically aware so that they can be aware of the vast internet world. And make use of e-commerce websites. 
4) We are looking forward to doing advertisements and helping this artform gain it's lost recognition.

 But now we are full fledged to work on it again. Looking forward to receiving this beautiful heritage of Prayagraj.
